I'm having a paper with latex project in @paper_latex/ and main body in @main.tex 
code for this research is stored in @QuasarNix 

we've got a review from journal requiring major revision, described in @paper_TOPS/decision.txt 
my assistants done analysis and summary of all feedback in @paper_TOPS/decision_summary.txt 

use local .venv and uv to run code

don't follow TDD paradigm here and skip any tests for this research work

when completing the work, answers to reviewer(s) should follow the following format (~150 words, highly formal academic style):
<thank reviewer>
<acknowledge limitation of current publication 1-2 sentences>
<state what was done 2-4 sentences in list>
