I'm having a paper with latex project in @paper_latex/ and main body in @main.tex 
code for this research is stored in @QuasarNix 

we've got a review from journal requiring major revision, described in @paper_TOPS/decision.txt 
my assistants done analysis and summary of all feedback in @paper_TOPS/decision_summary.txt 

use local .venv and uv to run code

don't follow TDD paradigm here and skip any tests for this research work
